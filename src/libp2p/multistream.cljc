  "multistream-select 1.0.0 — how two libp2p peers agree on what to speak next
  (github.com/multiformats/multistream-select).

  Every libp2p connection is a stack negotiated one layer at a time: security
  (Noise), then a muxer (Yamux), then an application protocol
  (`/ipfs/kad/1.0.0`). multistream-select is the same three-line conversation
  at each layer.

  ## The wire format is one rule

  Every message is a **varint-length-prefixed UTF-8 string ending in `\\n`**,
  and the newline is **inside** the length. That single detail is where
  implementations diverge: sending the length of the string without the
  newline, or the newline outside the prefix, produces a stream the other side
  cannot frame — and because the very first message is the protocol id itself,
  the failure looks like the peer speaking an unknown protocol rather than a
  framing bug.

  ## The conversation

      → /multistream/1.0.0        both sides open with this
      ← /multistream/1.0.0
      → /noise                    the dialer proposes
      ← /noise                    echo means accepted
        …or…
      ← na                        not available; propose the next one

  The responder **echoes** the protocol to accept it. It does not send `ok` or
  a code — the echo *is* the acceptance, and a responder that replies with
  anything else has ended the negotiation.

  `ls` (list supported protocols) exists in the spec and is deliberately not
  implemented here: it lets any peer enumerate everything a node speaks, which
  is free reconnaissance, and every real negotiation works without it.

  Pure: this namespace frames and interprets messages. Whoever owns the socket
  feeds it octets and writes what it returns."
