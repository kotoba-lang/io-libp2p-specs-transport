  "Yamux over the Noise-secured socket, driven by Node's async `net.Socket` —
  the piece `libp2p.provider.node/dial!` stops short of.

  `kotoba.net.libp2p.connection` already implements this whole stack
  (multistream → Noise XX → multistream → Yamux → per-stream multistream),
  correctly and with tests, but as a **synchronous** `{:read! :write!}` port:
  `read!` blocks the calling thread until N octets exist. That is exactly what
  a JVM `Socket`'s blocking streams give you for free, and exactly what a
  Node.js `net.Socket` cannot: the event loop is how MORE bytes ever arrive, so
  a `read!` that busy-waits on it never sees them arrive.

  So this namespace does not reuse `connection.cljc`'s port — it reimplements
  its control flow as a promise-driven poll, the same technique
  `libp2p.provider.node/read-until!` already uses for the Noise handshake, one
  layer further up. What IS reused, unchanged, is every *pure* decision:
  `libp2p.multistream`, `libp2p.yamux`, `noise.cipher-state`'s AEAD, and
  `libp2p.provider.node`'s own frame predicates (`take-ms-message!`,
  `take-noise-frame!` — both already generic over 'some atom holding buffered
  octets', not tied to the raw socket inbox). Only the *pump* — what decides
  when to try decrypting one more Noise frame vs. wait for one more TCP
  packet — is new.

  ## Two pump depths, because Yamux itself is negotiated

  Before `/yamux/1.0.0` is accepted, plaintext flowing over the secure channel
  is raw multistream text — there is no muxer yet, so nothing on it is
  Yamux-framed. `presecure-step-until!` only ever decrypts Noise frames into
  `plain-buf` and re-checks a predicate against the raw bytes.

  After acceptance, EVERY plaintext octet is inside a Yamux frame — including
  the per-stream multistream negotiation for whatever protocol a stream
  carries. `step-until!` adds the frame-dispatch layer: decode one Yamux frame
  off `plain-buf`, route it (ping→ack, go-away, reset-or-accept an
  unrecognised inbound SYN depending on `:accept-protocols`, or append DATA to
  the owning stream's own buffer), and only fall back to decrypting another
  Noise frame once `plain-buf` holds no complete frame. Using the framed
  poller before the muxer exists would try to parse a multistream string's
  length-prefix byte as a Yamux version octet and fail the connection on the
  first read.

  ## A request/response protocol is not necessarily one stream

  `negotiate-protocol!` + `write-length-prefixed!` + `read-length-prefixed!`
  on the SAME stream id this side opened is correct for protocols where the
  peer replies on the stream it was asked on (`/ipfs/id/1.0.0`, `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0`).
  It is NOT correct for Bitswap: go-bitswap's network layer opens a FRESH
  stream toward the peer for every Message it sends — including the reply to
  a want — rather than writing back on the stream the want arrived on.
  Measured against a real Kubo peer (both a local test node and public
  network peers): our want-block negotiates `/ipfs/bitswap/1.2.0` and is
  written on our stream cleanly, and Kubo answers by opening a NEW
  even-numbered stream carrying its own multistream proposal + a
  length-prefixed `Message`. A client that only reads the stream it dialed
  waits out its timeout with the answer sitting unread in a stream it never
  looked at — and, before this was fixed, a client whose default policy was
  to Yamux-RESET every inbound SYN it did not recognise destroyed that answer
  before it could even be buffered. `accept-protocols` opts a connection
  into NOT doing that for named protocols, and `accept-stream!` runs the
  listener half of multistream on whichever inbound stream arrives so a
  caller can read it like any other."

  for reasons that have nothing to do with what we are waiting for — identify
  push is the one measured against a real Kubo peer — and multistream gives
  us no positive signal that one of those is going nowhere: we answer its
  proposal `na`, and if the peer had nothing else to offer it simply stops
  writing (there is no per-stream close notification this pump acts on, only
  whole-connection go-away). Capping how long ONE candidate gets before we
  move to the next is what keeps a decoy stream from consuming the entire
  `accept-stream!` budget and starving the actual answer arriving on a later
  stream — id 4 arrived strictly after id 2 in the measurement that motivated
  this (identify-push, then the real Bitswap reply)."

(defn accept-stream!
  "Wait for the peer to open a stream toward us and run the LISTENER half of
  multistream-select on it, accepting any of `supported`. Returns a Promise
  of `{:stream-id id :protocol proto}`.

  Tries pending streams IN ARRIVAL ORDER, each capped at
  `accept-stream-candidate-cap-ms` (not the full `timeout-ms`) — a stream
  that never resolves to one of `supported` is skipped rather than failing
  the whole call, so a decoy stream opened before the one we actually want
  cannot exhaust the budget by itself. Overall elapsed time is still bounded
  by `timeout-ms` across every candidate and every wait for a new one to
  arrive.

  Only ever resolves for a connection made with a non-empty
  `:accept-protocols` at `connect-and-secure!` time — with the default empty
  set every inbound SYN is reset before it reaches `:pending`, so this would
  wait out `timeout-ms` and fail every time, which is the point: opting in is
  explicit, not inferred from calling this.

  Symmetric to `negotiate-protocol!` (the dialer half, on a stream WE
  opened) — this is for protocols where the peer answers by opening a
  stream of its OWN, which is how go-bitswap replies to a want (see the
  namespace docstring's '## A request/response protocol is not necessarily
  one stream')."
