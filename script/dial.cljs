  "Dial one libp2p peer and print the handshake result.

  Usage:

      nbb --classpath 'src:../noise/src:../bytes/src:../dev-protobuf/src:script'
          script/dial.cljs <host> <port>

  The classpath needs this repo, `kotoba-lang/noise`, `kotoba-lang/bytes` and
  `kotoba-lang/dev-protobuf`, plus `@noble/*` resolvable from node.

  Exit status is 0 only on a completed handshake. A refusal, a timeout and a
  transport error are all non-zero and each says which it was, so a failed
  measurement is never reported as an empty one."
